## Bug Fixes

- **The Dockerfile builds on 32-bit ARM again** ([#1808](https://github.com/Ride-The-Lightning/RTL/pull/1808)).
  0.15.17 moved the image to `node:24-alpine`
  ([#1798](https://github.com/Ride-The-Lightning/RTL/pull/1798)), which publishes no
  `linux/arm/v7` image, so building the Dockerfile for 32-bit ARM failed, both in the release
  workflow and natively on a 32-bit ARM board. The 0.15.17 arm/v7 image was built separately on
  `node:22-alpine`. The Dockerfile now picks `node:22-alpine` for 32-bit ARM itself (override with
  the `ARM32_BASE_DISTRO` build argument) and keeps `node:24-alpine` for amd64 and arm64.
